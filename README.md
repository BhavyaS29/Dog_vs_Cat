# Image Classification - Cat or Dog

Image classification refers to a process in computer vision that can classify an image according to its visual content. For example, an image classification algorithm may be designed to tell if an image contains a human figure or not. While detecting an object is trivial for humans, robust image classification is still a challenge in computer vision applications. This is a image classification project.

For details please check [Dog_vs_Cat.ipynb](https://github.com/patrick013/Image-Classification-CNN-and-VGG/blob/master/Dog_vs_Cat.ipynb).
In this project, I applied convolutional neural network for image classification. And the end, I also applied VGG-16 convolutional neural network by using transfer learning. VGG-16 is a popular deep learning neural network in computer vision. The structrue of VGG 16 network is following:
